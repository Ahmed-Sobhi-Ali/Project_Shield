# Project Shield

Welcome to **Project Shield**! This project represents a cutting-edge, comprehensive data protection system designed to elevate data security by focusing on both data integrity and confidentiality.

## Overview

**Project Shield** is meticulously crafted to offer a highly reliable and secure environment for managing and protecting sensitive information. With a deep passion for designing and programming personal tools, I have utilized my advanced expertise in cryptography to develop a system that I can trust and depend on for my personal use. The system is composed of several intricately interconnected components, each precisely engineered to ensure the highest level of security and reliability.

## Key Features

### 1. Authentication
The system employs a rigorous authentication process that requires a password, which is compared against a pre-existing hash value. This hash value is not known to users and acts as an additional layer of security. The real authentication process involves encrypting user data with a key that is dynamically generated based on a specific value. This value is never stored or managed outside the program’s runtime, ensuring that even with the encrypted data and the system itself, decryption cannot occur without knowledge of this value.

### 2. Encryption Algorithm
The encryption algorithm chosen is AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. This choice is grounded in my deep proficiency in designing and evaluating encryption algorithms. The AES CBC mode is selected for its robustness and suitability for the system’s requirements, providing top-notch data security.

### 3. Data Shredding
**Project Shield** includes a data shredding feature that ensures files are deleted beyond recovery. This functionality adheres to the stringent standards of the U.S. Department of Defense’s DoD 5220.22-M for secure file deletion. Whether you need to permanently remove files, this tool will execute it efficiently and thoroughly.

### 4. Data Integrity
The system also ensures data integrity by storing hashes of user-specified files. Each time the program runs, it recalculates and compares the hashes of these files with the stored values, providing alerts if any changes are detected. This continuous monitoring ensures that any unauthorized alterations are promptly identified.

### 5. Log Monitoring
**Project Shield** automatically records any actions performed using the system. These logs are crucial for analyzing and understanding any events or changes, offering transparency and accountability. The logging mechanism provides a detailed account of all activities, which can be reviewed for security auditing and incident investigation.

## Future Enhancements

This initial release of **Project Shield** is just the beginning. Future updates will include:
- **AI-Powered Security Analysis**: An advanced AI system for analyzing logs and user behavior to detect suspicious activities and potential threats.
- **Comprehensive Program Monitoring**: Full monitoring of programs attempting to write to files, with capabilities to block them if they pose a danger.
- **Enhanced Ransomware Protection**: Mechanisms to prevent ransomware from completing its encryption processes, offering robust protection against ransomware attacks.
- **Secure Communication System**: Development of a secure communication channel for enhanced data transmission security.
- **Self-Destruction Mechanism**: A feature that enables files to be automatically destroyed in case of imminent threats, ensuring critical data remains secure.
